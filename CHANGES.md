##### Note on backward compatibility
The [backward incompatible](http://ydk.cisco.com/py/docs/backward_compatibility.html) changes introduced with `0.6.0` python release include:
   * **Installation:** When installing `YDK-Py`, there is a new system requirement which needs to be installed. This is the `libydk` library, which is available on the DevHub website for various OS platforms. Please refer to the [system requirements](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-py/blob/master/README.rst#system-requirements) for details.
   * **Windows support:** From release ``0.6.0`` onwards, YDK is no longer supported on the Windows platform. We plan to add back support for this platform in the future.
   * **API changes:** Please refer to the [developer guide](http://ydk.cisco.com/py/docs/developer_guide.html) and [API guide](http://ydk.cisco.com/py/docs/api_guide.html) for details about APIs and how to use them.
   * `NetconfServiceProvider` no longer has the `close()` method. There is no need to explicitly close the provider as it will be automatically cleaned up when the object goes out of scope.
   * `YFilter` has replaced the functionality of the `READ` and `DELETE` objects
   * When using logging, the suggested level for users of YDK is `INFO` as `DEBUG` provides highly detailed logging suitable for developers working on YDK
   * The type names of `enumerations` and `identities` no longer have `Enum` or `Identity` in their names. For example, the  identity `InterfaceTypeIdentity` in `ydk.models.ietf.ietf_interfaces` is now renamed to just `InterfaceType`
   * The ``is_config()`` method is no longer available for the YDK model APIs.    This may be added back in a future release.

#### C++
 * Renamed some of the methods in path API to be verbs like `DataNode::get_schema()` instead of nouns like `DataNode::schema()` ([#498](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-gen/pull/498))

  * Support `get`/`get-config` with no filter in path API ([#503](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-gen/pull/503))
 * Introduce optimized on-demand yang model downloading for `NetconfServiceProvider` ([#499](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-gen/pull/499))
 * Add support for choosing either a per-device or a common cache for storing downloaded yang models ([#502](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-gen/pull/502))
 * Introduced encoding/decoding subtree XML in `CodecService` and changed `CRUDService` to use XML subtree filtering to create filters for the `read` operation ([#489](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-gen/pull/489))
 * Added support for non-standard RPCs as well in path API ([#498](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-gen/pull/498))
